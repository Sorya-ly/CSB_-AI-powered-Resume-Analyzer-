Her exceptional entrepreneurial drive, leadership in innovation programs, and commitment to community service highlight a blend of technical aptitude and impactful soft skills. While her resume effectively showcases her ability to identify problems and conceptualize solutions, it could be significantly strengthened by further detailing her specific technical contributions in projects and expanding her listed technical skills. By refining these areas, she will be exceptionally well-positioned for entry-level roles that value both technical potential and a proactive, innovative mindset, ready to make a tangible impact in the tech industry.\n",

While Soryapheak has a B.S. in Software Development and relevant coursework (Java Programming, Networking Essentials, Data Structure), there is no explicit mention of Python, Django, practical experience with REST API implementation, or specific database systems like PostgreSQL in her skills or project experiences. Her current experience leans more towards entrepreneurial ideation and soft skills rather than hands-on backend development with these particular technologies.\n"
